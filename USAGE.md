# Laszy: LiDAR Data Processing Tool

## Overview
Laszy is a Python-based tool designed for processing LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. It provides functionalities for handling, analyzing, and reporting on LiDAR data, typically stored in LAS or LAZ file formats. The tool is structured into two main components: `Laszy.py` for core processing and `LaszyReport.py` for generating reports based on the processed data.

## Installation
To use Laszy, ensure that the required Python libraries are installed, including `laspy`, `lazrs`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and others as specified in the script imports.

```bash
pip install laspy lazrs pandas numpy tqdm
```

   Before using Laszy functions, import the script into your Python environment.
   ```python
   import Laszy
   ```

2. **Processing Data**
   Use the functions within `Laszy.py` to process your LiDAR data. The exact functions and parameters will depend on the specifics of `Laszy.py`.

### LaszyReport.py
`LaszyReport.py` is used to generate reports from the processed LiDAR data.
